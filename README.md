Wraps the PUBG REST API for convenient access from ruby applications.

Documentation for the PUBG REST API can be found here: [https://documentation.playbattlegrounds.com/en/introduction.html](https://documentation.playbattlegrounds.com/en/introduction.html)

If you need help please jump into the Discord server [https://discord.gg/GZpFFN](https://discord.gg/GZpFFN)

Notice this wrapper is still in development. Im sure some things are broken when dealing with PC match data. Ive been testing using an xbox account.
